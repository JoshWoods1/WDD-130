    <h2>Josh Woods</h2> 
    <p>I am a computer science major</p>
    <p>I love playing any kind of sport, especially soccer.
    <p>I am not married a don't have kids either.</p>
<p>I've never really done too many things with computers before so I'm in a bit of a new field.</p>
<p>I love being around others who have similar standards, and I love being near mountains.</p>
<p>I don't know too many advantages of web design careers but it seems fun so far. I'm learning a bit more about programming/coding though.</p>
<p>I've been a member for my whole life. My favorite scripture is 3 Nephi 9:22!</p>
